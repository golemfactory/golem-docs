# Retrievable tasks (Job API)

## Introduction

The [Task Model](/docs/creators/javascript/guides/task-model) is a great way to get started with Golem Network. It allows you to run tasks on the network in a simple and straightforward way - you just need to call the `run()` method and await the promise. However, it has some limitations. With more complex and time-consuming tasks, you may want to have access to the state, results and/or error messages of the task outside the function scope. This is where the Job API comes in handy.

## Job API

The Job API is very good at three things:

- **Retrieving the state of the task** - you can check if the task is still running, or if it has finished and get the results or error message.
- **Cancelling a running task** - you can cancel a running task at any time.
- **Reacting to task state changes** - you can easily add callbacks that will be called when the task state changes (e.g. when the task begins execution on the provider, or when it finishes).

To see the Job API in action, take a look at [this quickstart](/docs/creators/javascript/quickstarts/retrievable-task). To see how this API is used in a real-world scenario, check out [the express tutorial](/docs/creators/javascript/tutorials/rest-api-with-express)

## Usage

### `GolemNetwork` object

The starting point for interacting with the Job API is the `GolemNetwork` object. This singular client establishes a connection to yagna and manages the global configuration utilized by every job. Here's how you can create it:

```javascript
import { GolemNetwork } from '@golem-sdk/golem-js'

const golemClient = new GolemNetwork({
  yagna: {
    apiKey: 'try_golem',
  },
  activity: {
    activityExecuteTimeout: 1000 * 60 * 60,
  },
  work: {
    activityPreparingTimeout: 1000 * 60 * 5,
  },
  // ... other configuration options
})
await golemClient
  .init()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to the Golem Network!')
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to connect to the Golem Network:', error)
  })
```

### Creating a job

The `Job` object represents a single self-contained unit of work that can be executed on the Golem Network. It's created by calling the `createJob()` method on the `GolemNetwork` object. Here's how you can create a job and begin its execution:

```javascript
const job = golemClient.createJob<string>({
  package: {
    imageTag: "golem/alpine:latest",
    minStorageGib: 8,
    minCpuCores: 4,
    minMemGib: 8,
  },
  // ... other configuration options
});

job.startWork(async (ctx) => {
  const response = await ctx.run("echo 'Hello, Golem!'");
  return response.stdout;
});

const result = await job.waitForResult();
```

### Cancelling a job

While the job is running, you can cancel it at any time by calling the `cancel()` method:

```javascript
const job = golem.createJob<string>({
  package: {
    imageTag: "golem/alpine:latest",
  },
});

job.startWork(async (ctx) => {
  const response = await ctx.run("echo 'Hello, Golem!'");
  return response.stdout;
});

await job.cancel();
```

### Listening to job state changes

The job object exposes an `EventEmitter` that emits whenever the job state changes. Here's how you can listen to these events:

```javascript
const job = golem.createJob<string>({
  package: {
    imageTag: "golem/alpine:latest",
  },
});

job.events.addListener("started", () => {
  console.log("Job started event emitted");
});
job.events.addListener("success", () => {
  console.log("Job success event emitted");
});
job.events.addListener("ended", () => {
  console.log("Job ended event emitted");
});
job.startWork(async (ctx) => {
  const response = await ctx.run("echo 'Hello, Golem!'");
  return response.stdout;
});


const result = await job.waitForResult();
```

Here's a list of all the events emitted by the job object:

- `created` - emitted immediately after the job is created and initialization begins.
- `started` - emitted when the job finishes initialization and work begins.
- `success` - emitted when the job completes successfully and cleanup begins.
- `error` - emitted when the job fails and cleanup begins.
- `canceled` - emitted when the job is canceled by the user.
- `ended` - emitted when the job finishes cleanup after success, error or cancellation.

### Getting the job state

You can get the current job state by accessing the `state` property:

```javascript
const job = golem.createJob<string>({
  package: {
    imageTag: "golem/alpine:latest",
  },
});

console.log("Job state before work starts:", job.state);

job.startWork(async (ctx) => {
  const response = await ctx.run("echo 'Hello, Golem!'");
  return response.stdout;
});


const result = await job.waitForResult();

console.log("Job state after work ends:", job.state);
```

Here's a list of all the possible job states:

- `new` - demand for the job has been created and is waiting for a provider to pick it up.
- `pending` - the job has been picked up by a provider and is in progress.
- `done` - the job has finished successfully.
- `rejected` - an error occurred while trying to run the job.

### Getting the job results or error message

`waitForResult()` is not the only way to get the job results or error message. You can also access them directly by accessing the `result` and `error` properties:

```javascript
const job = golem.createJob<string>({
  package: {
    imageTag: "golem/alpine:latest",
  },
});

job.startWork(async (ctx) => {
  const response = await ctx.run("echo 'Hello, Golem!'");
  return response.stdout;
});

try {
  const result = await job.waitForResult();
  console.log("Job finished with result:", result);
  // or
  console.log("Job finished with result:", job.result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Job failed with error:", job.error);
}
```

### Retrieving the job by ID

You can retrieve the job by ID by calling the `getJobById()` method on the `GolemNetwork` object:

```javascript
const job = golem.createJob<string>({
  package: {
    imageTag: "golem/alpine:latest",
  },
});

job.startWork(async (ctx) => {
  const response = await ctx.run("echo 'Hello, Golem!'");
  return response.stdout;
});
const jobId = job.id;

// ... later in the code

const sameJobAgain = golemClient.getJobById(jobId);
const results = await sameJobAgain.waitForResult();
```

## When not to use the Job API

The Job API is great for running isolated tasks that may take a long time to complete. However, it's not a good fit for scenarios where you need to run multiple short-lived tasks in parallel. For these scenarios, you should use the [Task Model](/docs/creators/javascript/guides/task-model) instead.
