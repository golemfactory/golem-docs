# REST API example with Express.js

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a REST API with Express.js that uses the Golem Network to process data. The goal is to show you how to use the [Job API](/docs/creators/javascript/guides/retrievable-tasks) in a real-world scenario.

## What will you build?

You will create a simple REST API that will allow you to send some text to the Golem Network and get back a text-to-speech result in the form of a WAV file.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have already installed Yagna and have it running in the background. If you haven't done so yet, please follow the instructions in [this tutorial](/docs/creators/javascript/examples/tools/yagna-installation-for-requestors) before proceeding.

## Setting up the project

First, create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project in it:

```bash
mkdir golem-express
cd golem-express
npm init -y
npm install @golem-sdk/golem-js express
```

## Creating the API

Let's start by creating a new file called `index.mjs` and pasting the following code into it:

```js
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.use(express.text())

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

Start your app by running `node index.mjs` and run `curl http://localhost:3000` in another terminal window. You should see the following output:

```bash
Hello World!
```

So far, so good! Stop the app by pressing `Ctrl+C` and let's move on to the next step.

## Connecting to the Golem Network

Now let's connect to the Golem Network. First, import the `GolemNetwork` class from `@golem-sdk/golem-js` and create a new instance of it.

```js
import { GolemNetwork } from '@golem-sdk/golem-js'

const golemClient = new GolemNetwork({
  yagna: {
    apiKey: 'try_golem',
  },
})
await golemClient
  .init()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to the Golem Network!')
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to connect to the Golem Network:', error)
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Let's also add a handler for the `SIGINT` signal so that we can close the connection to the Golem Network and cancel all running jobs when the user presses `Ctrl+C`:

```js
process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
  // cancel and cleanup all running jobs
  await golemClient.close()
  process.exit(0)
})
```

## Creating a retrievable task

Now it's time for the fun part! Let's add a new endpoint to our API that will take some text from the request body and create a new job on the Golem Network. To do that, we will use the `createJob()` method. This method will give us a `Job` object that we can use to get the state of the job and its results later. On the provider side, we will run the `espeak` command to convert the text to speech, save it to a `.wav` file and download that file to your local file system with the `downloadFile()` method. We will give the file a random name to avoid collisions.

The image we will use is `severyn/espeak:latest`, provided by one of our community members. It contains the `espeak` command, which we will use to convert the text to speech. If you're feeling adventurous, [you can create your own image](/docs/creators/javascript/examples/tools/converting-docker-image-to-golem-format#building-your-docker-image) and install [espeak](https://espeak.sourceforge.net/) on it.

```js
app.post('/tts', async (req, res) => {
  if (!req.body) {
    res.status(400).send('Missing text parameter')
    return
  }
  const job = golemClient.createJob({
    package: {
      imageTag: 'severyn/espeak:latest',
    },
  })

  job.startWork(async (ctx) => {
    const fileName = `${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2)}.wav`
    await ctx
      .beginBatch()
      .run(`espeak "${req.body}" -w /golem/output/output.wav`)
      .downloadFile('/golem/output/output.wav', `public/${fileName}`)
      .end()
    return fileName
  })
  res.send(`Job started! ID: ${job.id}`)
})
```

The `Job` api makes it easy to react to events that happen during the execution of the job. Let's update our code and add some event handlers to log the events to the console:

```js
app.post('/tts', async (req, res) => {
  if (!req.body) {
    res.status(400).send('Missing text parameter')
    return
  }
  const job = golemClient.createJob({
    package: {
      imageTag: 'severyn/espeak:latest',
    },
  })

  job.events.on('created', () => {
    console.log('Job created')
  })
  job.events.on('started', () => {
    console.log('Job started')
  })
  job.events.on('error', () => {
    console.log('Job failed', job.error)
  })
  job.events.on('success', () => {
    console.log('Job succeeded', job.results)
  })

  job.startWork(async (ctx) => {
    const fileName = `${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2)}.wav`
    await ctx
      .beginBatch()
      .run(`espeak "${req.body}" -w /golem/output/output.wav`)
      .downloadFile('/golem/output/output.wav', `public/${fileName}`)
      .end()
    return fileName
  })
  res.send(`Job started! ID: ${job.id}`)
})
```

## Getting the job state

Now let's add another endpoint that will allow us to get the state of the job. We can get the job by its ID with the `getJobById()` method. Then we can simply return the state of the job to the user.

```js
app.get('/tts/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const job = golemClient.getJobById(req.params.id)
  if (!job) {
    res.status(404).send('Job not found')
    return
  }
  res.send("Job's state is: " + job.state)
})
```

## Getting the job results

Finally, let's add an endpoint that will allow us to get the results of the job. Here we will use the `getJobById()` method again to get the job by its ID. In case the job is still running, we will wait for it to finish with the `waitForResult()` method. Then we will get the results of the job with the `results` property and return them to the user.

Let's also serve the files in the `/public` directory so that the user can access them. We will use the `express.static()` method for that.

```js
// serve files in the /public directory
app.use('/results', express.static('public'))

app.get('/tts/:id/results', async (req, res) => {
  const job = golemClient.getJobById(req.params.id)
  if (!job) {
    res.status(404).send('Job not found')
    return
  }
  if (job.state !== JobState.Done) {
    await job.waitForResult()
  }

  const results = await job.results
  res.send(
    `Job completed successfully! Open the following link in your browser to listen to the result: http://localhost:${port}/results/${results}`
  )
})
```

## Testing the app

We're done with the code! Let's start the app and test it.

First, let's start the server:

```bash
node index.mjs
```

### Sending a POST request

Open a new terminal window. Let's send a POST request to the `/tts` endpoint. Feel free to replace `Hello Golem` with any text you want:

```bash
curl \
Â  Â  --header "Content-Type: text/plain" \
Â  Â  --request POST \
Â  Â  --data "Hello Golem" \
Â  Â  http://localhost:3000/tts
```

You should see the output:

```bash
Job started! ID: <job_id>
```

Make sure to write down the job ID, as we will need it in the next step.

### Sending a GET request to get the job state

Now let's send a GET request to the `/tts/<job_id>` endpoint to get the state of the job:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/tts/<job_id>
```

You should see the output:

```
pending
```

Wait a few seconds and send the same request again. You should see the output:

```
done
```

### Sending a GET request to get the job results

Finally, let's send a GET request to the `/tts/<job_id>/results` endpoint to get the results of the job:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/tts/<job_id>/results
```

You should see the output:

```
Job completed successfully! Open the following link in your browser to listen to the result: http://localhost:3000/results/<file_name>
```

Open the link in your browser, and you should hear the text you sent to the API!

Congratulations! You have just created a REST API that uses the Golem Network to process data! ðŸŽ‰
