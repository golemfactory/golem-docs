# JS QuickStart Explained

{% alert level="info" %}

This tutorial has been designed to work with the following environments:

- OS X 10.14+, Ubuntu 20.04 or Windows
- Node.js 16.0.0 or above

{% /alert %}


## Prerequisites 
Yagna service is installed and running with `try_golem` app-key configured.

## Setting up the project

Create a project folder, initialize a Node.js project, and install the `@golem-sdk/golem-js` library.

```bash
mkdir golem-example
cd golem-example
npm init
npm i @golem-sdk/golem-js
```

## JS script structure

The basic structure of the script:

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "@golem-sdk/golem-js";

(async () => {
     //... Function body in here 
})();
```

Here we do two things:

* import TaskExecutor from @golem-sdk/golem-js and 
* create IIAFE (Immediately Invoked Async Function Expression). It has an async function declaration because TaskExecutor provides async methods.


## Utilizing Task Executor instance

Inside the function body, there will be a sequence of 3 steps, that constitute the simplest Task Executor lifecycle. Task Executor is a primary object provided by our Task API.  

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "@golem-sdk/golem-js";
(async () => {

    // 1. Create Task Executor Instance
    const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
        package: "529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4",    
        yagnaOptions: { apiKey: 'try_golem' }});
    
    // 2. Run the task
    const taskResult = await executor.run( /*taskToRunOnProvider to be provided here */);

    
    // 3. Finish Task Executor
    await executor.end();

    console.log("Task result:", taskResult);

})();
```

In (1) we create a TaskExecutor Instance using a factory method. In this example, we use the minimal set of parameters: namely the hash indicating the image with Node.js installed - the image we will deploy on the provider and api-key value - a key that will give us access to `yagna` REST API. `yagna` is a service that connects us to the network. 
We use api-key that was generated in the process of [Yagna installation](/docs/creators/javascript/examples/tools/yagna-installation-for-requestors)

```js
 const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
        package: "529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4",    
        yagnaOptions: { apiKey: 'try_golem' }});
```

Next (2) we run the task. Here we use a run method that accepts a task function as its argument. We will define the task function in a moment. We store the result of the `executor.run()` in taskResult variable. 

There are other methods that allow you to execute tasks. They are briefly presented in [Task API Guide](/docs/creators/javascript/guides/task-model#main-task-api-features) and explained in [examples](/docs/creators/javascript/examples) section.


```js
    const taskResult = await executor.run(taskToRunOnProvider);
```

Finally (3) we gracefully finish task executor:

```js
    await executor.end();
```


## Defining task function

Letâ€™s see how the task is defined and replace the `taskToRunOnProvider` placeholder we used in the previous step.

The task is defined as a function that implements the Worker interface. This function will get its parameter `workerContext` from the executor. It is an object that lets you run your commands in the scope of one task on one provider. 

```js
const taskToRunOnProvider = async (ctx) => // task is defined here;
```

Our task in this example is simple and consists of a single command: namely `node -v`. We will use the async method `run()` of workerContext `ctx`. The output of this method is a `Promise` of a `result` object, once it is resolved it contains the output of the command we run, available as a `stdout` property.

```js
const taskToRunOnProvider = async (ctx) =>  (await ctx.run("node -v")).stdout;
```

The output of the task function is passed to `executor.run()` and assigned to taskResult. 
Finally, we print it to the console.


```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "@golem-sdk/golem-js";

(async () => {

    const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
        package: "529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4",    
        yagnaOptions: { apiKey: 'try_golem' }});
    
    const taskResult = await executor.run(async (ctx) => (await ctx.run("node -v")).stdout);
    
    await executor.end();
    
    console.log("Task result:", taskResult);

})();
```

## Summary

We had created the simplest requestor script, that ran a single command on a remote computer. 
To achieve it we had:

- imported @golem-sdk/golem-js lib
- utilized Immediately Invoked Async Function Expression
- created Task Executor
- defined a task as a function that runs our command
- finally read the command result from the result object and provide it to the user


In this example, we ran a simple command (node -v) in a shell on the remote computer. You can run other executable programs in more interesting scenarios. See other examples for more advanced use cases.
