# Ray on Golem CLI

Ray on Golem exposes a command line interface to help you manage the cluster.

This article explains the commands available, which are useful when working with Ray on Golem.

## Commands Overview

Ray on Golem supports the following commands

- `ray-on-golem network-stats golem-cluster.yaml` scans the network and offers information about available providers ([details](#network-stats))
- `ray-on-golem webserver` starts Golem requestor service controlling the providers used by the cluster

## Network stats

The tool scans the network and gives you an overview of the availability of the providers.
It allows you to test the settings of your [cluster yaml](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml) file.

You can use it to verify and fine-tune different [budget control](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#avoiding-too-expensive-providers) parameters,
both on [the testnet and the mainnet](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#network).

### Example usage

```bash
ray-on-golem network-stats golem-cluster.yaml --duration 5
```

```

Proposals count:
Initial: 48
Not blacklisted: 48
Passed Reject if per cpu expected cost exceeds `max_cost` = 1.5: 48
Passed Reject if start price exceeds `max_start_price = 0.5: 48
Passed Reject if cpu per hour price exceeds `max_cpu_per_hour` = 0.5: 48
Passed Reject if env per hour price exceeds `max_env_per_hour_price` = 0.5: 48
Negotiation initialized: 48 
Negotiated successfully: 37

Negotiation errors:
Outbound rejected because: Everyone rule didn't match whitelist ; Audited-Payload rule requires manifest signature ; Partner rule requires node descriptor ; : 4
No capacity available. Reached Agreements limit: 1: 2
Failed to send proposal response! Request timed out: 1
Failed to send proposal response! 500: {"message":"Failed to send response for Proposal [***]. Error: Countering Proposal [***] GSB error: GSB failure: Net: error forwarding message: Connection timed out.."}: 1
```

### Duration

Golem Network is peer-to-peer, which means there is no central registry of providers offers. Therefore,
providers proposals are not immediately available to a newly-connected requestor. They get re-broadcasted at a certain interval and accumulate over time.

Additionally, negotiating with individual providers also takes some time.

Use the `--duration` parameter to set how long you want your network scan to last. It allows time to gather and negotiate the incoming proposals

### Output

- `Initial` proposals found during the scan (there might be more than one proposal per provider)
- `Not blacklisted` - proposals coming from non-blacklisted providers (we blacklist providers with a history of misbehaving)
- `Passed Reject if per cpu expected cost exceeds` - proposals not exceeding your [`max_cost` setting](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#choosing-the-cheapest-providers-maximum-expected-usage-cost)
- `Passed Reject if start price exceeds` - proposals not exceeding your [`max_start_price` setting](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#maximum-provider-prices)
- `Passed Reject if cpu per hour price exceeds` - proposals not exceeding your [`max_cpu_per_hour_price` setting](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#maximum-provider-prices)
- `Passed Reject if env per hour price exceeds` - proposals not exceeding your [`max_env_per_hour_price` setting](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#maximum-provider-prices)
- `Negotiation initialized` - proposals passing all the above limitations
- `Negotiated successfully` - providers ready to deploy the Ray on Golem image

At the end of the output, you can see the reasons for failing negotiations.
The most interesting are the reasons around providers' outbound settings, but for now, we don't offer any actionable follow-up.

### Nodes availability

The scanning ends with the successful negotiations - the `Negotiated successfully` line shows you the potential size of your cluster.
Notice that the availability is dynamic - providers might be hired by someone else, more providers might become available, and more providers might get discovered while your cluster is alive.

The last thing is the image deployment. When starting the actual cluster (with `ray up`) the providers might also fail to start the Ray on Golem image. This might decrease the maximum size of your cluster too.
