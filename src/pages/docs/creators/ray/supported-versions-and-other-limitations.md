# Supported versions and other limitations

The current version is `pre-alpha` which means the happy path is working on the Golem test network.
We use this version to show the direction and get feedback.

## Python and Ray image base

The Ray on Golem image contains `ray 2.7.1` and `python 3.10.13`.
It should work with any combination of local Ray and Python versions.

Please let us know if you have any troubles because of that (on [`#Ray on Golem` discord channel](https://chat.golem.network/))

## Platforms

We have tested Ray on Golem on Ubuntu and WSL, but it should work on other Linux distributions. For now, we don't support MacOS or bare Windows.

## Libraries

Ray on Golem image contains only the basic Python libraries.

If you need any dependencies in your Ray app,
you can use `pip` via [cluster yaml `initialization_commands`](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml#initializationcommands)

You can also instruct Ray on Golem to use the needed libraries during execution by passing the `runtime_env` parameter to `ray.init()`.
It is demonstrated for example in [this tutorial](/docs/creators/ray/conversion-to-ray-on-golem-tutorial#passendplaylibraryrequirementtoray).
