# Golem-Workers Hello Service Example

This example demonstrates how to run a simple "Hello" service using Golem-Workers. 
Unlike the **Stable Diffusion** example, this service does not require a GPU and can be run for free on the **testnet**. 
It is designed as a basic introduction for new users, with more advanced examples like 
the [Stable Diffusion tutorial](/docs/creators/golem-workers/sd-example) available for further exploration.

## Prerequisites

We will be using **`curl`** (for Windows users consider PowerShell command `Invoke-WebRequest` instead) 
to interact with the Golem-Workers API, which runs on **localhost:8000** 
(see [Getting started](/docs/creators/golem-workers/getting-started) if it is not).
All API requests will use **JSON data** to configure and manage the Golem-Workers service.

The JSON files used in this article can be found in the repository under the directory **`examples/hello-example`**. 
Make sure you run the `curl` commands from within this repository to ensure the paths to the JSON files are correct.

Feel free to experiment and modify the JSON files if youâ€™d like to adjust configurations or explore different setups.

## 1. Create a Cluster

To start, create a cluster with any name you choose (`cluster_id`). For this example, we'll use `example` as the `cluster_id`.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/create-cluster' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data @create-cluster.json 
```

This is the json file you have just used (also available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-workers/raw/main/examples/hello-example/create-cluster.json)):
{% codefromgithub url="https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-workers/raw/main/examples/hello-example/create-cluster.json" language="json" %}

{% /codefromgithub %}


### `create-cluster` JSON explained

- **Budget**: We set up a budget using `golem_workers.budgets.AveragePerCpuUsageLinearModelBudget` to limit costs.
In this example, we specify that the node should not cost more than **1.5 tGLM**,
assuming it runs for **0.5 hours** with **1 CPU** in use.

- **Network**: The network configuration sets up an IP range for the cluster nodes.

## 2. Create a Node

Next, create a node using the **Hello Service** image from the Golem Registry. 
This service listens on port **80** and simply returns "Hello" when accessed.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/create-node' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data @create-node.json
```

This is the json file you have just used (also available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-workers/raw/main/examples/hello-example/create-node.json)):
{% codefromgithub url="https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-workers/raw/main/examples/hello-example/create-node.json" language="json" %}

{% /codefromgithub %}

### `create-node` JSON explained

- **Image**: The node runs the **Hello Service** image `modelserve/echo-test:2`,
which is a simple NGINX-based service that returns "Hello" on port **80**.
- **Commands**: We deploy the node and start the service using NGINX.
- **Port Forwarding**: We forward port **80** on the node to **localhost:8080** on your machine,
allowing you to access the service locally.

## 3. Get the cluster's status

Next, you should wait until your node is up.
Check the cluster and node state with a call to `get-cluster`:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/get-cluster' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data @get-cluster.json
```

This is the json file you have just used (also available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-workers/raw/main/examples/hello-example/get-cluster.json)):
{% codefromgithub url="https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-workers/raw/main/examples/hello-example/get-cluster.json" language="json" %}

{% /codefromgithub %}

## 4. Access the Hello Service

Once the node is **started**, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
You should see the message **Hello** displayed.

## 5. Stop the Cluster

After you're done, you should shut down the cluster using the following command:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8000/delete-cluster' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data @delete-cluster.json
```

This is the json file you have just used (also available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-workers/raw/main/examples/hello-example/delete-cluster.json)):
{% codefromgithub url="https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-workers/raw/main/examples/hello-example/delete-cluster.json" language="json" %}
