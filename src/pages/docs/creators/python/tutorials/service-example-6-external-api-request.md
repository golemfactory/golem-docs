# Making External API Requests with Golem Network Using Yapapi

This guide explains how to enable outbound networking for your Golem applications using Yapapi. Outbound networking allows your applications to access external APIs or services by defining specific requirements and securing trust with providers. Using the **golem-cert-companion** tool, you can automate the process of generating manifests, descriptors, and certificates required for this functionality.

---

## Why Are Manifests and Node Descriptors Required?

By default, the Golem Network includes a restrictive whitelist of URLs for outbound networking. This default list ensures a high level of security, limiting internet access to a predefined set of trusted domains. You can find the current whitelist [here](https://github.com/golemfactory/ya-installer-resources/tree/main/whitelist).

However, many applications require access to APIs or other external services not included in the whitelist. To allow this, Golem enables users to define specific requirements through manifests and node descriptors. These files:

- Specify the URLs your application needs to access.
- Are signed with a certificate, which must be trusted by providers before your application can access external resources.

### The Role of Provider Trust

When you submit a task requiring outbound networking, the Golem Network looks for providers that meet the task’s requirements **and trust your certificate**. Without this trust:

- **Providers will not accept your task**: If no providers trust your certificate, the task will remain in a pending state and will not start.
- **Default whitelist restrictions apply**: Without trusted manifests, your application is limited to the URLs allowed by the default whitelist.

To ensure your task runs successfully:
1. Generate and sign a manifest and node descriptor.
2. Share your certificate with providers and request their trust.

## Automating Cert Generation with golem-cert-companion

Manually creating manifests and node descriptors can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. The **golem-cert-companion** tool streamlines this by automating the creation of:

- **`manifest.json`**: (Must be attached in your task)
- **`node-descriptor.signed.json`**: (Must be attached in your task  )
- **`root-cert-template.signed.json`**: (The signed certificate that providers must trust first)

---

## Steps to Enable Outbound Networking

### Step 1: Install golem-cert-companion

Install the tool using pip:

```bash
pip install golem-cert-companion
```

### Step 2: Generate Required Files

Run the tool:

```bash
golem-cert-companion
```

or its shortcut:

```bash
gcert
```

The tool will guide you through:

1. **Image URL or SHA3 hash**: These options specify the image to be downloaded and deployed on providers. 
   - The **image URL** is a direct link to the location where the image can be downloaded.
   - The **SHA3 hash** is the default identifier generated by `gvmkit-build`, which retrieves the corresponding image from the Golem registry automatically, instead of relying on a custom URL.

   For instance, if your application uses `curl` for outbound API requests, you might use a Golem image URL like:

   ```
   http://yacn2.dev.golem.network:8000/docker-golem-script-curl-latest-d75268e752.gvmi
   ```

   Alternatively, you can provide the SHA3 hash generated by `gvmkit-build`, which automatically uploads the image to the Golem registry and makes it available for deployment.

2. **Outbound URLs**: Define the external APIs or URLs your application will access:
   - Specify individual URLs (e.g., `https://api.coingecko.com`).
   - Allow unrestricted access if your application needs to reach multiple domains.

Once you've provided this information, the tool will generate:

- `manifest.json`: Specifies the URLs and tools used by your application.
- `node-descriptor.signed.json`: Signed details about your node’s capabilities.
- `root-cert-template.signed.json`: Certificate for providers to trust your tasks.

---

### Step 3: Share the Certificate with Providers

Providers must trust your certificate for outbound networking to work. Share your `root-cert-template.signed.json` file with providers and ask them to import it using:

```bash
ya-provider rule set outbound partner import-cert root-cert-template.signed.json --mode all
```

You can also request trust through the [Golem Discord](https://chat.golem.network) `#providers` channel with a message like this:

> Hi providers!  
> I have tasks that require outbound internet access. If you'd like to run these tasks, please trust my certificate:  
> 
> 1. Download the certificate: [Your Link]  
> 2. Import it using:  
> ```bash
> ya-provider rule set outbound partner import-cert root-cert-template.signed.json --mode all
> ```
>  
> Thank you!

## Yapapi Example: Fetching Data from an External API

The following Yapapi example demonstrates fetching the current price of Golem (GLM) from the Coingecko API.

### Code Example

{% codefromgithub url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemfactory/yapapi/refs/heads/master/examples/external-api-request/external_api_request_partner.py" language="python" /%}

---

### Key Components of the Example

1. **Manifest and Node Descriptor**: These files define the application's requirements for outbound networking.
2. **Capabilities**: The `inet` capability enables internet access for the application.
3. **Outbound Request**: The example uses `curl` to fetch data from the Coingecko API.
