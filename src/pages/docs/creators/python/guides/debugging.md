# Debugging with the use of log files

When developing applications on Golem, sooner or later you will get to a point where something is not working as expected. Executing commands on the provider-hosted container seems to be one of the most error-prone areas. If something is going wrong on the provider side, we need to have a tool that helps us in the identification of the problem. When we know what the error details are, it usually is much easier to correct our code and eliminate the bug.

## Introducing log files

The good news is that Golem's high-level API supports log files. The log files contain all sorts of interesting stuff. Among others you will find there:

- Requestor > Provider file transfer details
- Output streams of the commands executed on the Provider: `stdout` and `stderr`
- Provider > Requestor file transfer details

## How to enable logging?

The logging infrastructure in Golem's high-level API is quite universal and thus somewhat complex, but for most of the cases using the `SummaryLogger` will do the job.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `SummaryLogger`is an event listener that listens to all the atomic events and combines them into the more aggregated track of events that is easier to grasp by humans.
{% /hint %}

To enable logging to a file we need two things.

```python
enable_default_logger(log_file=args.log_file)
```

**1.** The`enable_default_logger` call which enables the default logger, which:

- outputs to the Requestor application's `stderr` all the log messages with the level `INFO`
- if the `log_file` is specified, outputs to the file specified all the log messages with the level `INFO` and `DEBUG`

**2.** Then in the `Executor`we add:

```python
async with Executor(
    ...
    event_consumer=log_summary(log_event_repr),
    ...
) as executor:
```

Here, the `log_summary` creates `SummaryLogger` instance that is passed as event consumer to the Executor we are creating.

## Let's have an error

{% hint style="info" %}
We are going to simulate some bug in the code now. We will take a fully working piece of code, modify it a bit (create the bug in the code that produces and error on the provider's side) and then, by analyzing the log file, we will track what the root cause of the problem is. In the end, we will fix the code and check the details of its work with the analysis of the log file.
{% /hint %}

Let's look at the code of yacat that is part of the Golem high-level Python API repository. All the code that enables logging is already there. We just need to use `--log-file` command-line switch.

{% embed url="https://github.com/golemfactory/yapapi/blob/master/examples/yacat/yacat.py" %}
In line 29 we are generating the body of `keyspace.sh` script to be executed on the provider:
{% /embed %}

Now we are simulating a typo in the code. Instead of:

`hashcat --keyspace -a 3 {mask} -m 400`

let's have the following code:

`hashcat --keeyspace -a 3 {mask} -m 400`

So, just an additional `e` character that has passed unnoticed. A typical developer day.

## Reading the log file

Let's try to track the effect of our typo in the contents of `log.txt` - the file that has been generated by yacat as a result of us using `--log-file log.txt`.

First, let's find the entry corresponding with the first `ctx.run` call. We can do it by searching the log.txt file (from the top of the file, for example by hitting Ctrl-F in our favourite file viewer) in search of

```python
command={'run'
```

This way, we can find a log entry that looks like this:

```python
[2021-01-22 15:20:16,273 DEBUG yapapi.events]
CommandStarted(agr_id='b39318a4c682010ea9be37201b8f428fad81b28cfe949ca11cca9912a465d34c',
task_id='1', cmd_idx=3, command={'run': {'entry_point': '/bin/sh', 'args':
['/golem/work/keyspace.sh'], 'capture': {'stdout': {'stream': {}}, 'stderr': {'stream': {}}}}})
```

Now, below it, there are the log entries we were looking for:

```python
[2021-01-22 15:20:16,383 DEBUG yapapi.events]
CommandStdErr(agr_id='b39318a4c682010ea9be37201b8f428fad81b28cfe949ca11cca9912a465d34c',
task_id='1', cmd_idx=3,
output="hashcat: unrecognized option '--keeyspace'\n\x1b[31mInvalid argument specified.\x1b[0m\n\n")
[2021-01-22 15:20:16,385 DEBUG yapapi.events]
CommandExecuted(agr_id='b39318a4c682010ea9be37201b8f428fad81b28cfe949ca11cca9912a465d34c',
task_id='1', cmd_idx=3, command={'run': {'entry_point': '/bin/sh', 'args':
('/golem/work/keyspace.sh',), 'capture': {'stdout': {'stream': {}}, 'stderr': {'stream': {}}}}},
success=False, message='ExeScript command exited with code 255')
```

There are two pieces of those log entries that are the most important to us:

`hashcat: unrecognized option '--keeyspace'\n\x1b[31mInvalid argument specified.\x1b[0m\n`

This is a `stderr` message generated by running the `hashcat` binary. It seems that `hashcat` does not recognize the `--keeyspace` parameter. This is indeed the error we simulated.

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations! You have just tracked the bug by analyzing the requestor log file!
{% /hint %}

The other interesting piece of information here is:

`ExeScript command exited with code 255`

From this message, we know that the effect of this `ctx.run` resulted in the exit code having a value of `255` which has been returned by `hashcat` on exit. If there was any additional information in the command exit code, we would be able to see it here.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `255` value, we have in the log file here is generated by equivalent of POSIX `exit(-1)` executed on the `hashcat` termination. The `-1` was converted to `unsigned int` and came back as`255`.
{% /hint %}

## Fixing the error

Now, we can use that knowledge to fix the `write_keyspace_check_script` function by bringing it back to the correct form:

```python
def write_keyspace_check_script(mask):
    with open("keyspace.sh", "w") as f:
        f.write(f"hashcat --keyspace -a 3 {mask} -m 400 > /golem/work/keyspace.txt")
```

After saving the corrected `yacat.py` file and executing with the same command as above:

```python
python yacat.py '?a?a?a' '$P$5ZDzPE45CLLhEx/72qt3NehVzwN2Ry/' --log-file log.txt
```

```
python yacat.py ?a?a?a $P$5ZDzPE45CLLhEx/72qt3NehVzwN2Ry/ --log-file log.txt
```

the problematic log fragment we analyzed above, becomes:

```python
[2021-01-22 16:22:17,217 DEBUG yapapi.events]
CommandStarted(agr_id='bf8c484e362af417cbf5fc440281debd5c5cf772b433f53e0ecb90b4faac55f4',
task_id='1', cmd_idx=3, command={'run': {'entry_point': '/bin/sh', 'args':
['/golem/work/keyspace.sh'], 'capture': {'stdout': {'stream': {}}, 'stderr': {'stream': {}}}}})
[2021-01-22 16:22:18,303 DEBUG yapapi.events]
CommandExecuted(agr_id='bf8c484e362af417cbf5fc440281debd5c5cf772b433f53e0ecb90b4faac55f4',
task_id='1', cmd_idx=3, command={'run': {'entry_point': '/bin/sh', 'args': ('/golem/work/keyspace.sh',),
'capture': {'stdout': {'stream': {}}, 'stderr': {'stream': {}}}}}, success=True, message=None)
```

As you can see, we have `success=True` there, which means that the `ctx.run` execution was successful.

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations! The bug has been corrected!
{% /hint %}

## Log files - what else is there?

In the log file, there is all the information you are already familiar with, because it is displayed as `INFO` messages in the `stdout` of the requestor application examples. Between the familiar `INFO` entries, you will find additional `DEBUG` messages. Let's have a look at the most interesting ones.

### Requestor > Provider file transfer details

The transfers of files from the Requestor to the Provider can be identified in the log as pairs of `CommandStarted` and `CommandExecuted` lines similar to:

```python
[2021-01-22 16:22:16,773 DEBUG yapapi.events]
CommandStarted(agr_id='bf8c484e362af417cbf5fc440281debd5c5cf772b433f53e0ecb90b4faac55f4',
task_id='1', cmd_idx=2, command={'transfer': {'from':
'gftp://0xf378a153b24fe98227ee153a0cb056faed155ba7/050a02b6976e59fbc1b9dfa6292d4f63942a820ee7dcc859af0a5efaea80c959',
'to': 'container:/golem/work/keyspace.sh', 'format': None, 'depth': None, 'fileset': None}})
[2021-01-22 16:22:17,217 DEBUG yapapi.events]
CommandExecuted(agr_id='bf8c484e362af417cbf5fc440281debd5c5cf772b433f53e0ecb90b4faac55f4',
task_id='1', cmd_idx=2, command={'transfer': {'from':
'gftp://0xf378a153b24fe98227ee153a0cb056faed155ba7/050a02b6976e59fbc1b9dfa6292d4f63942a820ee7dcc859af0a5efaea80c959',
'to': 'container:/golem/work/keyspace.sh'}}, success=True, message=None)
```

The source file name is identified by

`'from':'gftp://0xf378a153b24fe98227ee153a0cb056faed155ba7/050a...'`

{% hint style="info" %}
The `gftp` is internal Golem protocol for transferring files in the Golem network.
{% /hint %}

The target file name is identified by

`'to': 'container:/golem/work/keyspace.sh'`

`success=True` informs us that the operation was successful.

### stdout of executing commands on the Provider

Any execution of the `ctx.run` function - which is what we use to run commands inside provider's execution units - will result in the following entries in the log file: a `CommandStarted`, followed by any number of `CommandStdOut` depending on the output produced by the command and finally, one `CommandExecuted`. For example, this is the result of yacat's main `ctx.run` :

```python
[2021-01-22 16:22:36,986 DEBUG yapapi.events]

```

The `output` parts of the `CommandStdOut` contain the `stdout` of the `ctx.run`. For example the beginning of the `hashcat` execution can be traced by `output='hashcat (v5.1.0) starting...\n\n'` .

### Provider > Requestor file transfer details

Getting files back from the provider to the requestor will leave a trace such as:

```python
[2021-01-22 16:22:18,304 DEBUG yapapi.events]
CommandStarted(agr_id='bf8c484e362af417cbf5fc440281debd5c5cf772b433f53e0ecb90b4faac55f4',

[2021-01-22 16:22:18,521 DEBUG yapapi.events] DownloadFinished(path='keyspace.txt')
```

The source filename is identified by `'from': 'container:/golem/work/keyspace.txt'` and the target filename is identified by `DownloadFinished(path='keyspace.txt')`.

## Docker exec - an alternative approach

Analyzing the requestor logs gives us the full picture of what is going on under the hood of Golem, but in some cases, it might be easier to start with executing a simple `docker exec`that runs commands on the container. The syntax of this docker command is:

```bash
docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]
```

This command can be used to execute the `ctx.run` scripts directly on the provider container. This is regular Docker usage, so we'll recommend you consulting the Docker's reference: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/)
