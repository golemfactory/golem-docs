## Disclaimer and privacy warning for the alpha reveal of The Next Milestone

This Disclaimer has been updated as of August 14th, 2023.

The Golem Platform is experimental open source software released under the GNU General Public License version 3 and may contain errors and/or bugs. No guarantee or representation whatsoever is made regarding its suitability (or its use) for any purpose or regarding its compliance with any applicable laws and regulations. Use of the software is at your own risk and discretion and by using the software you warrant and represent that you have read this disclaimer, understand its contents, assume all risk related thereto and hereby release, waive, discharge and covenant not to hold liable Golem Factory GmbH or any of its officers, employees, or affiliates from and for any direct or indirect damage resulting from the software or the use thereof. Such to the extent as permissible by applicable laws and regulations.

**I. Golem Platform**
The underlying software protocol (the "Software") that governs the Golem Platform is developed and published under the GNU General Public License version 3, which forms an integral part of this Disclaimer [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). You understand and accept that the Software is provided "as is" and any expressed or implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed. Your use of the Golem Platform and any of your corresponding activities as well as feedback provided to the Company do not give you any rights and/or claims against the Company.

As the Software is of experimental nature and deployed for testing purposes only, you acknowledge that this alpha version of the Software, even though developed in accordance to state of the art, is likely to: contain bugs, defects, or errors (including any bug, defect, or error relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing, storage, transmission, or use of data) that materially and adversely affects the use, functionality, or performance of the Golem Platform or any product or system containing or used in conjunction with the Golem Platform.

Also, core to the Golem Platform built-in feature set is a dedicated Ethereum-based transaction system, which enables direct transactions between Requestors and Providers. All such transactions in the Golem Platform are made in GLM and require ETH as gas.

With the aim of reducing the costs for the Users, the individual payment transactions can be bundled and carried out on Ethereum-based Layer 2 transaction systems. You hereby acknowledge that it may therefore take up to 30 business days for the payment to be withdrawn from Ethereum-based Layer 2 transaction systems and become accessible to you on the Ethereum main chain. All such transactions in the Layer 2 may be performed using native tokens for completing transactions and paying gas fees (e.g. gas costs in MATICs or ETHER for Polygon transactions).

THE GOLEM PLATFORM IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND ANY REAL ETH OR GLM SENT TO A LIKELY INSECURE SOFTWARE ARE AT RISK OF BEING LOST INDEFINITELY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE RISK OF A NON-PAYMENT EVEN AFTER 30 BUSINESS DAYS.

For the experimental reasons and with the aim of reducing the resulting risk, Golem Platform offers "**test network**” (or “**testnet**”) or several test networks as a separate instance of a blockchain network that is specifically designed for testing and experimentation purposes of Golem Platform. It's a replica of the main blockchain network (referred to as the "mainnet") but operates with its own environment for to test new applications, upgrades, and features without the risk of interruption. Each test network serves a different purpose (e.g. there might be a test network focused on scalability, security, or compatibility with certain types of applications). Golem Platform may use a different or multiple test networks for a controlled testing environment (e.g Rinkeby testnet, Goerli testnet or others). For more information about the currently used networks check the tutorials and examples in the [documentation portal](https://docs.golem.network).

You understand and acknowledge that GLM in testnet ("NGNT/tGLM") and tETH neither carry any value nor do they represent rights or claims. NGNT/tGLM and tETH are automatically generated by the relevant testnet for (technical) testing purposes only. Your NGNT/tGLM and/or tETH as well as possible loss thereof (for whatever reason) do not give you any rights and/or claims against the Company.

Privacy warning: Please be aware, that by using the Golem Platform, among others your testnet Ethereum address, channels, channel deposits, settlements and the Ethereum address of your channel counterparty will be stored on the Ethereum testnet chain, i.e. on servers of Ethereum testnet node operators and ergo are to a certain extent publicly available. The same might also be stored on systems of parties running Golem Platform nodes connected to the same network. Data present in the Ethereum testnet chain is very unlikely to be able to be changed, removed or deleted from the public arena.

The Golem Platform is highly experimental and is only to be used on Ethereum testnet. Any real ETH or GLM sent to likely insecure software is at risk of being lost indefinitely. The Company will not reimburse you for such loss of real ETH or GLM.

**II. Disclaimer of Warranty**
There is no warranty for the software, to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing. The Company provides the software "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the software is with you. Should the software prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

**III. Services and Availability**
All Users acknowledge that the Company only provides the technical applications to enable the contact between the Requestors and Providers within the testnet and/or mainnet for testing purposes. The Company is not liable for any contact between the Users. The Company is not liable for any breach of duty arising from the contracts concluded between the Users (including non-fulfillment of a contract) and the Company can not be held responsible for the quality of any work results / computations ordered by a Requestor through the Golem Platform. The Users are solely responsible for the execution and fulfillment of the contracts between Requestors and Providers.

The Users acknowledge that a 100% availability of the Golem Platform is technically not possible. Events beyond the Company's control can lead to short-term disruptions or temporary suspension of the Golem Platform. The Company excludes, as far as legally permissible, liability for all damages in connection with service interruptions.

**IV. Limitation of Liability**
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL THE COMPANY, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE SOFTWARE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR THE NON-PAYMENT OF A FEE ), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**V. Assumption of Risks of Cryptographic Systems and Currencies**
By using the Golem Platform in any way, you acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like GLM or ETH, smart contract based tokens such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard and blockchain-based software systems.

You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain technologies and associated currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent that the Company cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.

You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the process of selling and buying GLM or ETH and that the Company does not offer any such service. The Company cannot be held liable for any losses or damages of GLM, ETH or other Cryptocurrencies resulting from the use of services from any third-party provider (i.e. exchanges).

**VI. Personal Data**
The Users acknowledge that by using and contributing computer resources to the Golem Platform certain personal information ("Personal Information", as further described in the User Interaction Guidelines) may be shared with the other Users of the Golem Platform.

**VII. Indemnification**

**VI. Internal Network Monitor**
The Company maintains an internal network monitor that collects various network statistics from the Golem Platform. The internal network monitor allows the Company to gather data regarding the functioning of the network and nodes in order to constantly improve and upgrade the network protocol and the Golem Platform application. The network statistics stored in the internal network monitor are also used to improve the performance of the Golem Platform but are more informative and accurate than the External Statistics.

When the user downloads and installs the software package, he or she will be asked during the installation procedure whether he or she wishes to contribute certain information about his or her node and the usage of the application to the internal network monitor. If the user decides to opt-in to contribute network statistics to the Company, the following information relating to the user's use of the application ("Internal Statistics") will be transferred to the Company and stored on its internal servers:

**Node ID, node name, node version, OS and system info, network IP, ports, node activity, node network traffic, etc.**

The storing of the Internal Statistics on the servers of the Company is required to display it on the internal monitor and to analyze it in order to improve the performance of the Golem Platform. In contrast to the External Statistics, the Internal Statistics are not replaced with but rather continuously enhanced by more current information. The internal monitor is therefore a historical reflection of the Golem Platform, providing the Company with an overview of everything that has happened on the Golem Platform in the past. The Internal Statistics are not available to the public and are not being shared with third parties.

The processing of the information, by storing the Internal Statistics on the internal network monitor, is based on the user's consent pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. a GDPR. The user shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. If the user wishes to end his or her contribution of information to the network monitor, he or she can opt out by using the command line interface of the Golem Platform application. To delete personal data that has already been submitted to the Company, the user can contact the Controller. For further information (incl. User’s rights) with respect to data protection please see our Privacy Policy.
