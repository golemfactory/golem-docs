## Provider architecture

The provider is a node with the Yagna service, with additional components installed. These components implement the provider logic. 
To make its resources available to the requestor, providers utilize an **execution unit** (exe-unit for short). Exe-unit starts and controls a runtime - the type of runtime depends on the type of image the requestor wants to run. Exe-unit also allows for interaction with the running runtime.

Currently, Golem provides:

- Virtual Machine (VM) runtime that runs images provided in GVMI format,
- WASM runtime that runs WebAssembly code

In our examples, we utilize VM runtimes that run a requestor-provided GVMI image.
