# Mainnet / Polygon GLM Conversion

Since the Beta.4 release of Golem, the Polygon network became the most common platform for payments between Golem requestors and providers.

While Polygon itself offers countless opportunities in the form of distributed exchanges and other DeFi platforms, one might still want to move their hard-earned GLM tokens to the safety of the Ethereum Mainnet, or conversely, get their mainnet GLMs to Polygon to pay for tasks on Golem.

Whatever your need, there may come a time when you'd like to send your GLMs one way or the other and the instructions below will serve as your guide.

For some of the instructions below you need to configure the Metamask wallet extension for your browser and add your wallet.

## Ethereum <-> Polygon

**Go to the** [**Polygon Website**](https://wallet.polygon.technology)

1. Select **Proof of Stake** and then **Native Bridge** (in the Wallet Features section)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Choose the token you want to receive and follow the instructions
4. Wait until the process is finished (it normally takes around 7-8 minutes). You can follow the current status of the transaction by clicking "View on Etherscan".

# MATIC tokens

Just like any transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet require ETH, operations on the Polygon network require Polygon's equivalent - MATIC.

- You can use the bridge to exchange other tokens to MATIC
- You can buy MATIC directly on trading platform
- If you possess GLM you can swap them for MATIC.
