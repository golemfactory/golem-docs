# Mainnet / Polygon GLM Conversion

Since the Beta.4 release of Golem, Polygon network became the default platform for payments between Golem requestors and providers.

While Polygon itself offers countless opportunities in the form of distributed exchanges and other DeFi platforms, one might still want to move their hard-earned GLM tokens to the safety of the Ethereum Mainnet, or conversely, get their mainnet GLMs to Polygon to pay for tasks on Golem.

Whatever your need, there may come a time when you'd like to send your GLMs one way or the other and the instructions below will serve as your guide.

{% alert level="info" %}
For some of the instructions below you need to configure the Metamask wallet extension for your browser and add your wallet.

## Ethereum <-> Polygon

**Go to** [**Polygon Website**](https://wallet.polygon.technology)

1. Select **Proof of Stake** and then **Native Bridge** (in the Wallet Features section)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Choose the token you want to get and follow the instructions
4. Wait until the process is finished (it normally takes around 7-8 minutes) > you can click "View on Etherscan" to see the status of the transaction

# MATIC tokens

Just like any transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet require ETH, operations on the Polygon network require Polygon's equivalent - MATIC.

- You can use the bridge to exchange other tokens to MATICs, or
- You can buy MATICS directly on trading platform or
- If you possess GLM you can swap them for MATICs.
