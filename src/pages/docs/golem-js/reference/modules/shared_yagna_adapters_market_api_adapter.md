## Type Aliases

### DemandRequestBody

Æ¬ **DemandRequestBody**: `Object`

A bit more user-friendly type definition of DemandOfferBaseDTO from ya-ts-client

That's probably one of the most confusing elements around Golem Protocol and the API specificiation:

- Providers create Offers
- Requestors create Demands
- Demands are used to create a subscription for Proposals - Initial ones reflect the Offer that was matched with the Demand used to subscribe
- Once the proposal is countered, it's countered with a "counter proposal" which is no longer Offer + Demand,
  but rather a sketch of the agreement - here both parties try to agree on the values of certain properties that
  are interesting from their perspective. These "negotiated proposals (of) ...." are buit using DemandOffeBaseDTO

#FIXME yagna - feedback in the note above
