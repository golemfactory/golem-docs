# Introduction to Golem Network Guides

Golem articles are classified as Examples, Tutorials, and Guides. Sometimes it is difficult to tell the type, as the content depends on the author's style.

As with every classification, it should be treated more as a guideline.

## Guides

Guides should introduce concepts and explain terms. They should also introduce appropriate wording that will be used to name the activities and relations between different entities.

Guides do not have to contain examples or detailed instructions. Rather they should contain a high-level overview of the process:

- Introduce terms
- Explain them
- Show the process

and refer to examples or tutorials for details.

## Tutorials and examples:

Examples should be possible to complete in one step. They should focus on specific topics and all relevant topics should be simplified

Tutorials, on the other hand, can be done in steps. there might be interactions between different elements that impact the proposed solution.
The steps can be from different areas: how to organize debugging, how to name the file, how to install a tool, and how to define a function in the code.


# Task model

As the normal body text is monotonous and boring (and difficult to read), make sure that __term__ are visible or even are in a form of a [link](#task-model) to specific sections or other articles.

## Remember this is a guide

As such, it should cover the topic broadly, and point to articles that explore it in more depth.

You can also provide an overview of interesting areas and point to specific examples or tutorials.
