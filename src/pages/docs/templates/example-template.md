# Introduction

Explain what will be demonstrated in this article.

## Prerequisites

Yagna service is installed and running with the `try_golem` app-key configured.

## Introduction

In this article we will present tha basic structure for an examples article.

## Prerequisites

Yagna service is installed and running with `try_golem` app-key configured.

## How to run examples

Create a project folder, initialize a Node.js project, and install the `@golem-sdk/golem-js` library.

```bash
mkdir golem-example
cd golem-example
npm init
npm i @golem-sdk/golem-js
```

Copy the code into the `index.mjs` file in the project folder and run:

```bash
node index.mjs
```

## Introduction

Examples should be simple and short with each code snippet ready to copy and run.

Examples should focus on single aspects and show how to use a given feature.

If you have more than one example, list them.

If there is a need to compare different points, use a table.

| Command          | Available in node.js | Available in web browser |
| ---------------- | :------------------: | :----------------------: |
| `run()`          |         yes          |           yes            |
| `uploadFile()`   |         yes          |            no            |
| `uploadJSON()`   |         yes          |            no            |
| `downloadFile()` |         yes          |            no            |

{% alert level="info" %}
You can notify readers about some important topics.
{% /alert %}

If all examples in the article follow a specific scenario, you can explain it here.

## Giving a title

Example titles should tell what is the outcome of the example.

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from '@golem-sdk/golem-js'
```

![replacement text for an image](/github-icon.png)

Images should be placed in /public folder.

## Another example

In the example, explain:

- Why readers might use it
- How they should use it
- Point to outcomes
- Point to interesting things that can tell readers more about the network

## Showing variants
