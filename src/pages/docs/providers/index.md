The Golem Network is a peer-to-peer network of computers. It is being created by a community of people who believe that decentralization is an idea that deserves their support and who want to participate and benefit from the Golem project.

You can also support our open-source project and earn some tokens by joining the network. All you need to do is to install our Yagna service. It is a simple and quick process. See our [instructions](/docs/providers/provider-installation) on how to quickly install the Yagna service and join the Golem Network.

Once you install the service, don't forget to [join](https://chat.golem.network/) the Discord channel of our community to meet great people who share the same values as you.
