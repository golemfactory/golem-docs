# Provider maintenance

## Prerequisites

Yagna service is installed and running.

## Introduction

In this article, we present commands related to the daily management of your Yagna.

- Checking the wallet address
- Checking the status of the wallet
- Upgrading Yagna

## Your Golem wallet address

Golem's wallet is automatically initialized for you the first time you start your `yagna` service and thus, an address associated with it is also generated automatically.

To have any kind of funds transferred to your Golem's wallet, you'll need its address. You may obtain it using the `id` command:

```bash
yagna id show
```

The value described as `nodeId` in the output is the Ethereum address of your Golem node and it's also the address of its wallet. Note it down so you can use it to supply your node with funds.


## Checking the status of your accounts

Depending on whether you're mainly running a provider node or a requestor one, your default network (blockchain) may be different.

Because of that, when you run `yagna payment status` to verify the state of your payment account and the amount of GLM tokens you have at your disposal, you may need to add the specific `network` and `driver` parameters to point to the network/driver combination that you're interested in.

In the context of running Golem on mainnet, here are the commands for each of the supported mainnet platforms:

{% tabs %}

{% tab label="Polygon" %}
```bash
yagna payment status --sender --network=polygon --driver=erc20
```
{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Ethereum mainnet" %}
```bash
yagna payment status --sender --network=mainnet --driver=erc20
```
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Upgrading Yagna 

When you start the Yagna service, it will check if a new version is available and, if so, will provide information in output logs displayed on the console.

If you want to check the current version of yagna, type:
```bash
yagna --version
```

To upgrade Yagna service, stop it (Ctrl-C) and follow this installation procedure: [(instructions)](/docs/providers/provider-installation).
