title: Introduction for Providers
---

In the network, you can have two roles: you can request hardware resources to run your apps - then you are a requestor, or you can share your idling hardware in exchange for GLM tokens - then you become a provider.

For all this to happen, each node must run a piece of software that implements the protocol that was designed by our open-source project. Yagna is our Rust implementation and is freely distributed to the community. If you have a computer running Linux, you can easily join the network and become a provider.

Your resources will be offered for Requestors to execute their tasks. These tasks are run in separate VMs and are isolated from your programs. You define how many resources you want to dedicate, and at any time, your processes have priority. You can switch off your computer whenever you want - you participate as much and when you want.

You set the price for your resources. Price is defined in GLM - a Golem Network token minted on the Ethereum network and available also in the Polygon Network. You can use the token to pay for your tasks in the network or exchange it for other tokens.

Once you install and configure your Yagna service, your resources are offered in the network. Since this moment, everything is done automatically: requestors can select your offer and send the task to your computer to execute it. Once the task is completed, the requestor will initiate a payment, based on the information on the actual usage of your resources. The transaction is performed on blockchain and as a result, you become an owner of some GLM.
