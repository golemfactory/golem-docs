## Introduction

In most of our examples, we demonstrate how to run a requestor script in Node.js. However, you can also run your scripts in a browser context. This example will explain how to do it.

{% alert level="info" %}

Before getting started, you need to install and launch the Yagna service in version 0.13.0+. Note that such a version is available as a `release candidate`. It can be installed using instructions for manual Yagna installation available [here](/docs/creators/javascript/examples/tools/yagna-installation-for-requestors).

{% /alert %}

{% alert level="warning" %}
In addition, follow the instructions to [set up the app-key](/docs/creators/javascript/examples/tools/yagna-installation-for-requestors), but start the Yagna with a parameter that allows you to handle REST API requests with a CORS policy. You can do this by running the following command:

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="MacOS / Linux" %}

```bash
yagna service run --api-allow-origin='http://localhost:8080'
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="Windows" %}

```console
yagna service run --api-allow-origin=http://localhost:8080
```

{% /tab %}

{% /tabs %}

The `--api-allow-origin` value should be set to the URL where your web application will be served.
In this example, we will use `http-server`.

{% /alert %}

## Setting up the project

```bash
mkdir web_golem
cd web_golem
npm install --global http-server
```

This will install the `http-server` utility to host our web page, where we will run our Golem app.

## HTML page

Next, we'll create the main `index.html` file with the following content:

{% codefromgithub url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemfactory/golem-js/master/examples/docs-examples/quickstarts/web-quickstart/index.html" language="html" /%}

In this layout, there are three elements:

- A "Run" button, which executes the script on Golem
- A "Results" container, which displays the results
- A "Logs" container, which displays the API logs

## Requestor script

Next, we'll create a `requestor.mjs` file with the following content:

{% codefromgithub url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemfactory/golem-js/master/examples/docs-examples/quickstarts/web-quickstart/requestor.mjs" language="javascript" /%}

Note the file contains the `run()` function that creates the body of the requestor script (similar to the one we use in Node.js) and a set of helper functions that will let us present the logs and results in the browser window.

Now, ensure you:

- have your Yagna APP key set to `try_golem` (as shown in the yagna installation instruction) and
- have a running Yagna service started with the `--api-allow-origin` properly set to `http://localhost:8080`

Launch `http-server` in the project folder.

```bash
http-server
```

{% alert level="warning" %}

If, instead of using the `try_golem` app key defined by using the `YAGNA_AUTOCONF_APPKEY` variable, you have created a unique app key, make sure you update the requestor.mjs code and set the proper value there. See [here](/docs/creators/javascript/examples/using-app-keys#js-task-api-examples-using-app-keys) for deails.

{% /alert %}

We should see our app available in the browser.

[Open localhost](http://localhost:8080/index)

If you click the **Run** button, after a while, in the result container, you should get the result of the script: `Hello World` and see the logs of executed commands in the log container.
