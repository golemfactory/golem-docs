## I am not receiving any tasks

{% problem /%}

You've set up as a provider on the Golem Network, but you're not receiving any tasks. This can be an effect of multiple causes:

1. Pricing Configuration: If your pricing is set too high relative to other providers, requestors might bypass your offer. You can compare your pricing with other top earners on the network by visiting the [stats page](https://stats.golem.network/network/providers/online).

2. Network Demand: The number of tasks available might be low due to a disparity between supply (number of providers) and demand (number of requestors). This is a typical marketplace dynamic where, at times, supply may exceed demand.

{% solution %}

1. Adjust Pricing: Review the current pricing trends on the [stats page](https://stats.golem.network/network/providers/online) and adjust your pricing competitively.

2. Stay Updated: Monitor the Golem Network for any updates or changes that might impact the distribution of tasks on the network.
