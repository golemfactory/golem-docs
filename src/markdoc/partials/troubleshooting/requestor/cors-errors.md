## Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://127.0.0.1:7465/payment-api/v1/requestorAccounts' from origin 'http://172.27.80.1:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

{% problem /%}

When trying to execute a requestor script in the browser, you may encounter the following error message:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://127.0.0.1:7465/me' from origin 'http://localhost:8080/'
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

```
**GET http://127.0.0.1:7465/me net::ERR_FAILED 200 (OK)**
```

or

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://127.0.0.1:7465/payment-api/v1/requestorAccounts' from origin 'http://172.27.80.1:8080'
has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check:
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

{% alert level="warning" %}

Note that in a case when you have an incorrect `api-key`, after the message about CORS you will receive response status 401 Unauthorized.

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://127.0.0.1:7465/me' from origin 'http://localhost:8080'
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:7465/me net::ERR_FAILED 401 (Unauthorized)
```

In such a case please validate that you're providing a valid `api-key` before diagnosing CORS settings.

{% /alert %}

{% solution %}

This error suggests that the request was blocked due to CORS not being configured on the endpoint.

To resolve the issue:

1. Make sure you start Yagna with the proper parameter: `yagna service run --api-allow-origin='http://localhost:3000'` (on Windows: `yagna service run --api-allow-origin=http://localhost:3000`) .

2. Retry the script.
