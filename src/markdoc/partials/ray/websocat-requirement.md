Additionally, a tool named [websocat](https://lib.rs/crates/websocat) is needed to wrap connections between your machine and Ray on the Golem cluster.
You can install websocat using [these instructions](https://lindevs.com/install-websocat-on-ubuntu/).

Verify websocat is present:
```bash
websocat -V
```
It should print something like:
```
websocat 1.11.0
```
