The example cluster config file contains payment information. As a default it runs for free on Golem testnet - it should be enough to try it out (which is all we are supporting for now).

The provided example Golem cluster config file defines a small Golem cluster with three nodes
that is configured to autoscale to up to 10 worker nodes.
The availability of the testnet machines might cap the size of your cluster.

If you want more details about the config file, check out the [cluster yaml reference](/docs/creators/ray/cluster-yaml-reference) article.
