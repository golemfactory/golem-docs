# QuickStart

This quickstart shows you how to set Ray and Ray on Golem up, start your cluster, test it, and then stop it.
It limits the explanation to the bare minimum - if you are looking for more details jump to [setup tutorial](/docs/creators/ray/setup-tutorial)

## Install software

{% partial file="ray/recommend-venv.md" /%}

The first step is installing Ray on Golem. It will install Ray as a dependency.

```bash
# install ray-on-golem and ray (recommended within a clean virtual environment)
pip3 install -U ray-on-golem
```

{% partial file="ray/installation-alert.md" /%}

## Set the cluster up

With the packages in place, you can download our sample golem cluster configuration yaml, and use it with `ray up` to start up the cluster.
It will give you a cluster of one node (which will expand when you feed it with work) on the Golem test network (free, but not very powerful)

```bash
# Download the golem-cluster.yaml
wget https://github.com/golemfactory/ray-on-golem/raw/main/golem-cluster.yaml

# In this command:
# * yagna starts in the background (if not running)
# * ray-on-golem cluster manager starts in the background
# * ray head node is started on a golem provider
ray up golem-cluster.yaml --yes

```

{% partial file="ray/consult-troubleshooting.md" /%}

## Execute a Ray application

{% partial file="ray/run-simple-task.md" /%}

## Stop the cluster

Finally, stop your cluster to free the Golem network providers and to avoid spending more than needed (the testnet is free, but good practice is a good practice).

```bash
# Tear down the cluster.
ray down golem-cluster.yaml --yes
```

## Summary

By completing the above quickstart you have successfully:

- Installed ray and ray-on-golem packages
- Downloaded the example golem cluster yaml and the example ray application
- Started up the Ray on Golem cluster
- Run the app on your local computer and then on the cluster
- Stopped the cluster

Congratulations!
