### Setting up the project

Create a project folder, initialize a Node.js project and install the yajsapi library.
```bash
mkdir golem-example
npm init
npm i yajsapi
```

### Introduction
You can execute a single task on a single provider or execute multiple tasks in parallel.
In the second scenario you can define how providers should be initialized and how many tasks you want to run at the same time.

In this article , the following examples are presented:

* Running tasks in parallel (map())
* Running tasks in parallel (forEach())
* Defining number of providers working in parallel
* Initializing providers
* Running a single task

### Running tasks in parallel using the map() method

If you want to run your tasks in parallel, you can use the `map()` method. 

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";

(async () => {
  const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
    package: "529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4",    
    yagnaOptions: { apiKey: 'try_golem' }
  });

 const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

 const results = executor.map(data, (ctx, item) => ctx.run(`echo "${item}"`));

 for await (const result of results) console.log(result.stdout);
   
 await executor.end(); 
    
  
})();

```
The method `map()` accepts an array that defines the total number of tasks to be executed and may contain the data used to define a task.
In the example we have an array of 5 elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and we use these values within the task function to define task steps. For each task another element from the `data` array is passed as an `item` and then used to customize argument for the `echo` command.

Note that the result of the executor `map()` is an asynchronous iterable object with each element accessible with the `for await` statement.

In the output logs you can have some interesting observations:

The provider `sharkoon_379_6` was engaged first. When he had finished his first task he was apparently still the only available provider and he received nother tasks to execute. In the meantime other providers were successfully engaged and the next tasks were dispatched to them.

Note that even though provider `sharkoon_379_8` was engaged before provider `10hx4r2_2.h`, the latter completed its task before the former. In the network different nodes offer varying performance. 


### Running multiple tasks in parallel using the forEach() method

If you do not need an object to facilitate processing results of all the tasks, you can use another method that can also execute tasks in parallel. Even if the `forEach()` method does not return an object to iterate through, you can still access the result object for each command within the task function.  

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";

(async () => {
  const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
    package: "529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4",    
    yagnaOptions: { apiKey: 'try_golem' }
  });


 const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 
 await executor.forEach(data, async (ctx, item) => {
  console.log((await ctx.run(`echo "${item}"`)).stdout);
});
   
 await executor.end(); 
    
  
})();
```

### Defining the number of providers used 

You can set the maximum number of providers to be engaged at the same time. The TaskExecutor will scan available proposals and engage additional providers if the number of actually engaged providers is lower than 'maxParallelTasks` and there are still some tasks to be executed.
If you do not define this parameter, a default value of 5 will be used.

Note that the actual number of engaged providers might be:
* lower than `maxParallelTasks`, if there are not enough providers available in the network.
* higher, when considering the total number of engaged providers for all the tasks in your job. Providers might get disconnected or simply fail, in which case the TaskExecutor will engage another one to maintain number of active workers at the level defined by `maxParallelTasks`.

Below, you can see how to define the maximum number of providers to be engaged.

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";

(async () => {
  const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
    package: "529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4",    
    yagnaOptions: { apiKey: 'try_golem' }, 
    taskOptions: {maxParallelTasks: 3} // default is 5
  });

 const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

 const results = executor.map(data, (ctx, item) => ctx.run(`echo "${item}"`));

 for await (const result of results) console.log(result.stdout);
   
 await executor.end(); 
    
  
})();

```


### Initialization tasks

Normally, when a larger job is divided into smaller tasks to be run in parallel on a limited number of providers, these providers might be utilized for more than one task. In such cases, each task is executed in the same environment as the previous task run on that provider. To optimize performance, you might decide that some initialization tasks need only be run once per provider. This can be particularly useful if you have to send a large amount of data to the provider.

You can address such a need using the `beforeEach()` method of the TaskExecutor. Here os an example:

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";

(async () => {
  const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
    package: "529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4",    
    yagnaOptions: { apiKey: 'try_golem' }, 
    taskOptions: {maxParallelTasks: 3}
  });

  executor.beforeEach(async (ctx) => {
    console.log(ctx.provider.name + ' is downloading action_log file');
    await ctx.uploadFile("./action_log.txt", "/golem/input/action_log.txt");
    
  });

  await executor.forEach([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], async (ctx, item) => {
     
     await ctx
       .beginBatch()
       .run(`echo `+ `'processing item: ` + item + `' >> /golem/input/action_log.txt`)
       .downloadFile("/golem/input/action_log.txt", "./output_"+ctx.provider.name+".txt")
       .end();
       
  });

  await executor.end();
    
  
})();

```

In the code we decreased the `maxParallelTasks` value from default value of 5, to make sure that some of our five tasks will be run on the same provider.

The `beforeEach()` method is used to upload a file to a remote computer, that will be used to log all future activity run on this provider. The task function used in the `beforeEach()` method contains additional `console.log` to demonstrate that even if the whole job consists of five tasks, the task function used in `beforeEach()` will be executed only once per provider. (Unless the provider disengages and is engaged again - in such a situation, its virtual machine would be created anew, and we would upload the file again there).

Note how we utilized the `ctx` worker context to get provider name using the `provider.name` property.

In the task function used in the `forEach()` method, we employed the `beginBatch()` to chain multiple commands - you can see more about this feature in the [Defining Tasks](commands.md) article.

![BeforeEach](/assets/before_log.png)

Log from this example shows that even if the provider `imapp1019_2.h` eventually was used to execute 3 tasks, it uploaded the log only once. It's output file downloaded after the last task was executed contained the following:


```
--------------------------- 
processing item: 1
processing item: 4
processing item: 5
```

These log once again illustrates that providers offer different performance levels. Even though `fractal_01_1.h` and `fractal_01_3.h` signed agreements before Task 1 was computed on `imapp1019_2.h`, this provider managed to complete Tasks 4 and Task 5 before they downloaded the `action_log` file and completed their first task. 


### Single run

Sometimes you don't need to run tasks in parallel and a single run is sufficient. In such cases, you can use the `run()` method as demonstrated in the example below. 


```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";

(async () => {
  const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({
    package: "529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4",    
    yagnaOptions: { apiKey: 'try_golem' }});
  
  const result = await executor.run(
    async (ctx) => (await ctx.run("node -v")).stdout);
  
  await executor.end();

  console.log("Task result:", result);
})();
```

The requestor script runs a single task defined by a task function: `ctx.run("node -v")`. The output of the command is available through stdout of the result object returned from the `ctx.run()` function:

Below, you can see the script logs:"

![Single run](/assets/run_log.png "Requestor script output logs")

In the logs, we can see that the requestor uses the Goerli network for payments (a test network). The task was executed once on a single provider.

In the table, we see a summary of the costs (paid here in test GLM), along with the result of the command which output the version of the node in the image deployed on the provider."
