## Installing and running Yagna 

Yagna is a daemon that will let you communicate with Golem Network and perform operations on it. Let's install it.

#### Install Yagna

=== "Easy installation"
    
    On Linux/ MacOS you can install it using our helper script like this:
    
    ```bash
    curl -sSf https://join.golem.network/as-requestor | bash -
    ```
    You might be asked to modify your PATH afterwards.

    

=== "Windows Manual installation"

    Alternatively, if you can't install in easy way, you will do it manually in the following way:
    
    1. Download the requestor package - prefixed `golem-requestor` - appropriate for your platform from: [https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/latest](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/latest).
    2. Unzip the archive to extract the two files: `yagna.exe` and `gftp.exe`.
    3. Copy those files to `C:\Windows\System32`.
	
    Note: the link will lead you to latest stable release, you can go to [https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases) and select other version if you want to explore preview features.

=== "Unix Manual installation"

    Alternatively, if you can't install in easy way, you will do it manually in the following way:
    
    1. Download the requestor package - prefixed `golem-requestor` - appropriate for your platform from: [https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/latest](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/latest).
    2. Unpack `yagna` and `gftp` binaries and put within somewhere in your PATH (e.g. copy them to /usr/local/bin on Unix-like systems) or add the directory you placed the binaries in to your PATH.

#### Start the daemon

Open a terminal (command line window) and  define the key to identify your application script:

=== "MacOS / Linux"

   
    ```bash
    export YAGNA_AUTOCONF_APPKEY=try_golem
    ```

=== "Windows"

    
    ```bash
    set YAGNA_AUTOCONF_APPKEY=try_golem
    ```

Then start the daemon:

```bash
yagna service run
```




#### Get some funds

Requesting tasks on Golem Network requires some credits on the network (GLM tokens). 
As this example will run on a test network you can get test credits.

Open another terminal and run the following command to complete configuration:

```bash
yagna payment fund
yagna payment init
```
