Golem network is a p2p network of computers. It is created by community of poeple who believe that decentralisation is an idea that deserves their support and who wants to participate and also take advantage from the Golem project.

All you need to do is to install our yagna daemon ....

Once you installed the daemon do nt forget to join discord channel of our community to meet great people who share the same value as you.

In the network you can have 2 roles: you can order the others to do some tasks for you - then you are a requestor, or you can run other user's tasks - then you become a providers.

For all this to happen each node must run a piece of software that implements the protocol that was designed by our open-source project. Yagna is our Rust implementation and is freely distributed to community. If you have a computer running Linux you can easily join the network and become a provder.

Programs of other network users are run in separate container and are isolated from your programs.
You define how much resoruces you want to dedicated and in any time your processes have priority. You can switch off you compouter whenever you want - you participate as much adn when you want.

You sets the price for your resorces. Price is defined in GLM a golemfactory token defined on Ethereum network. You can use the token to pay for your tasks in the network or monetarize it on the exchange.

Once you install and configure your daemon your resources are offered in the network. Since thsi moment everything is done automatically: requestors can select your offer and once agreement is signed, send the task to your computer to execute it. While the tasks are running your node will send debitNotes to obtain ongoing requestor acceptacne and once the task is done you send an invoice in Golem. Transaction is performed on blockchain and as a result you bevome en owner of some GLM.  

You can support our open source project and earn some tokens by joining the network. Is is simple and quick process. See our tutorial how to quickly install yagna deamon and join the Golem Network.
