    show    Show current settings
    help    Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

```

#### Settings set

`golemsp settings set --help` - to see how to change settings. Invoking this will prompt usage, flags, and options.

example

```bash
$ golemsp settings set --help
golemsp-settings-set 0.3.0
Change settings

USAGE:
    golemsp settings set [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --node-name <node-name>             
        --cores <num>                       Number of shared CPU cores
        --memory <bytes (like "1.5GiB")>    Size of shared RAM
        --disk <bytes (like "1.5GiB")>      Size of shared disk space
        --starting-fee <GLM (float)>        Price for starting a task
        --env-per-hour <GLM (float)>        Price for working environment per hour
        --cpu-per-hour <GLM (float)>        Price for CPU per hour
        --account <account>                 Account for payments [env: YA_ACCOUNT=]

                                            [possible values: mainnet, testnet]

```

In order to change a particular setting (for eg. price settings) type:

`golemsp settings set --cpu-per-hour 3`

You can also combine multiple settings in one command as follows:

`golemsp settings set --cpu-per-hour 3 --cores 7` which will change your GLM per hour to "3" and adjust the numbers of shared CPU cores to "7".

**To change the default Ethereum address that was created for you during the initial setup process type:**

`golemsp settings set --account <address>`

and restart your node afterwards for it to update. To check if your address has been updated properly run `golemsp status`

#### Settings show

`golemsp settings show` - Show current settings.

```bash
$ golemsp settings show

`golemsp status` - Print out the status of your node.

When the node is not running you'll see:

```
$ golemsp status
┌─────────────────────────────┐

```

In the three columns, you can check the basic information regarding the status of your node

#### Status

* Whether your node is running
* Version of your node (with commit, build date and build number)
* Name of your node
* Subnet in which your node is currently running
* VM status

#### Wallet

* Account address
* Payment network: `mainnet` or `rinkeby`
* Amount of tokens that you have earned for successful computation
* On-chain amount of tokens that you have earned (explorer [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) or [rinkeby.etherscan.io](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/))
* Zk-sync amount of tokens that you have earned (explorer [zkscan.io](https://zkscan.io) or [rinkeby.zkscan.io](https://rinkeby.zkscan.io/))
* Pending payments that you should receive for computation
* Amount of tokens that is still unconfirmed and may not show on your account

#### Tasks

* Number of tasks that you were computing in last hour
* Number of tasks that were in progress during the last hour
* Total task that you were trying to compute - including those that were not computed

### Exit GLM tokens to Ethereum

While not specific to the provider CLI, at some point you may want to move your tokens. By default, mainnet tasks are paid on Layer 2. Assuming you have a local wallet, you can interact with the payment driver to exit your tokens from Layer 2 to Layer 1. This is done using the`yagna payment exit` command. With this command there are two main flags to keep in mind; `--network`and `--to-address`.

For `--network`you have two options, either `mainnet` or `rinkeby`. For `--to-address`you can specify a destination address other than the local wallet address.

**To exit your GLM to the same address on Ethereum mainnet type:**

`yagna payment exit --network=mainnet`

**To exit your GLM to a different address on Ethereum mainnet type:**

`yagna payment exit --to-address=<address> --network=mainnet`

**Note that if you decided to use an external wallet during your setup process, you can connect to ZkSync's wallet at** [**https://wallet.zksync.io/**](https://wallet.zksync.io/) **and exit that way. In the scenario that a different payment driver is being used, you will need to use the relevant available options to connect and access your tokens.**

## Advanced Settings

`ya-provider` allows to fine-tune the config created with `golemsp settings` using commands `config`, `preset`, `profile`, and `exe-unit`.

Additionally, it enables configuration of the certificate keystore and of the domain whitelist, which are used to control what kind of outbound traffic is allowed out of the VM containers run by the requestors on your machine.

### Keystore

The provider has an embedded certificate keystore which is used to validate any additional permissions for the payload launched by the requestors.

By default it contains only Golem public certificate which allows to execute [example app](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/service-development/service-example-6-external-api-request) and apps from trusted by Golem creators (certificates allow to verify incoming _Demand_'s [Computational Payload Manifests](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/computation-payload-manifest)).

Run `ya-provider keystore --help` to see possible subcommands

### Domain whitelist

The [Computational Payload Manifests](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/computation-payload-manifest) embedded in the Demands can specify a list of URLs which may get called by the services running on a Provider. If the manifest declares requests to URLs in domains that are not whitelisted, it must come with a [signature and app author's public certificate](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime/computation-payload-manifest). By default, the domains `whitelist` consists of a curated set of public websites and APIs like github, dockerhub or public Ethereum nodes.

Run `ya-provider whitelist --help` to see possible subcommands
