# Creating and using images on Golem

This article will go through the process of creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, then converting to a Golem image and using it in a requestor script.

!!! info
    
    * Tutorial is designed for: OS X 10.14+, Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04, and Windows
    * Docker service running is required
    * Required to have followed the [gvmkit-build installation](../examples/installing-gvmkit-build.md)
    * Required: an installation of yagna, and an installation of yarn

## Creating the Dockerfile

This is our simple `Dockerfile` we are going to use, using the debian base image, creating one volume, and changing the work directory. Simply create a file with the name `Dockerfile`, without any file extension, and paste the following contents:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:latest
VOLUME /golem/work
WORKDIR /golem/work
```

## Building the Docker image

To build the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`, we can run the following command in the same directory (`.`) as the Dockerfile to build an image tagged `golem-example`:

=== "Ubuntu"

    ```bash
    docker build -t golem-example .
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t golem-example .
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```bash
    docker build -t golem-example .
    ```

The output should look like this:

```

Use 'docker scan' to run Snyk tests against images to find vulnerabilities and learn how to fix them
```

!!! info

    Note that the image won't be turned into a file in the same directory. You don't need to see this file, but if you do, search the internet for where images are stored in your operating system.


## Converting from Docker to Golem, and uploading it to the registry

Now when you have a Docker image built, we can convert it to a Golem image. To save time, we will also upload it to the registry with the same command. To do this, you need to run the appropriate command that uses `gvmkit-build` to convert and push the image `golem-example` to the registry.

=== "Python/pip"
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        python3 -m gvmkit_build golem-example --push --nologin
        ```
    === "macOS"
        ```bash
        python3 -m gvmkit_build golem-example --push --nologin
        ```
    === "Windows"
        ```bash
        python -m gvmkit_build golem-example --push --nologin
        ```

=== "JavaScript/npm"

    ```bash
    gvmkit-build golem-example --push --nologin
    ```

=== "Rust/cargo"

    ```bash
    gvmkit-build golem- --push --nologin
    ```

After running the command, you will see an output that looks like this:

```bash

 -- chunked upload finished successfully
 -- image validated successfully
```

The hash is found after the `image link`, which in this case gives us the hash `28704b5186fb46099b6138e6f1db814a631f6963da456492476d0db9`. If you ever lose your hash, you can always recover/re-generate it from running the same command again.

## Preparing the environment

To include the `yajsapi` library, we need to prepare our environment with the following commands:.

```
npm init
npm install yajsapi
```

We can now create our `index.mjs` requestor file, with the `package: ...` matching our image hash.

=== "JavaScript/npm"
    **index.mjs**
    ```mjs
    import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";
    (async () => {
    const executor = await TaskExecutor.create({ package: "28704b5186fb46099b6138e6f1db814a631f6963da456492476d0db9" });
    await executor.run(async (ctx) => {
        await ctx.uploadFile("image_description.txt", "/golem/work/image_description.txt");
        var result = (await ctx.run('cat image_description.txt')).stdout;
        console.log(result);
    });
    await executor.end();
    })();
    ```

Lastly, create a `image_description.txt` file to be uploaded and used on the provider:

```txt
The image hash is `28704b5186fb46099b6138e6f1db814a631f6963da456492476d0db9`. By changing out the hash to another from another image, the provider will have another environment.

The result is the console output of the `cat /golem/work/image_description.txt` command. By changing this, we can experiment with other functionality.

We also run the uploadFile command to upload the text file you're reading right now from the local machine to the provider machine.
```

## Running the script

Run the following command after ensuring the yagna service is running and configured correctly:

```node index.mjs```

You have now successsfully created and used your own Golem image in a requestor script!

<!-- !!! info

    Note that the full path is required in all commands from a requestor script, regardless of what was specified in the `WORKDIR` instruction in your Dockerfile. This means that you upload and download files, and point commands to a directory and a file and not just a file.
     -->

<!--
!!! example "Challenge yourself:"

    Try see if you can change the command so that it logs out the contents of the file or if you can figure out how to download the file to your own computer.
