# Publishing an image in the registry (identified by tag)

!!! info

    * The tool works on: OS X 10.14+, Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04, and Windows
    * Required: [gvmkit-build installation](installing-gvmkit-build.md)
    * Required: a Docker image 
<!--
    is gvmi required??? see the above point
    * ??? Have you [Docker image converted to .gvmi format](converting-an-image.md) ???
    * Have [gvmkit-build installed](installing-gvmkit-build.md) 
-->

Note: you can also use npx / pipx tools to run gvmkit-build, the former for not having to install the tool, and the latter for isolation.
    


## Publishing custom Golem image to the registry (tag-based)

Note: Golem image tags have a format of `username/repository_name:tag`, where `username` is your login to registry portal, `repository_name` is name of your repository and `tag` is a text that you chose to describe the content/version of the image. The `tag` can be `latest` to constantly keep a latest version, or you can use a versioning system and e.g. make it `v0.0.1` and so on.

Let's assume for this example you username is `golem`, your Docker image is tagged `golem-example`, your repository name is `my_example` and the version is `latest`.


1. Create an account on the [registry portal](https://registry.golem.network/).
2. Create a repository on the registry portal.
3. Crate and copy personal access token from the registry portal.
4. Run the following command (you will be asked for login and personal access token)

=== "JavaScript/npm"
    ```bash
        gvmkit-build golem-example --push-to golem/my_example:latest
    ```
=== "Python/pip"
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
            python3 -m gvmkit_build golem-example --push-to golem/my_example:latest
        ```
    === "macOS"
        ```bash
            python3 -m gvmkit_build golem-example --push-to golem/my_example:latest
        ```
    === "Windows"
        ```bash
            python -m gvmkit_build golem-example --push-to golem/my_example:latest
        ```


Your tag `golem/my_example:latest` is ready to use in one of Golem Network APIs
