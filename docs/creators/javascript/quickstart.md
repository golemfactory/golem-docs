---

# QuickStart

In this article, we'll show you how to launch your first JavaScript app on Golem Network from scratch in 15 minutes. We have divided the entire article into 4 sections:

* [Preparing the environment](quickstart.md#preparing-the-environment)
* [Installing yagna requestor](quickstart.md#installing-yagna-requestor)
* [Building your first JavaScript application on Golem Network](quickstart.md#building-your-first-javascript-app-on-golem-network)
* [Run Node.js script on provider](quickstart.md#run-nodejs-script-on-provider)

The purpose of this article is not to get into the details, but to show you **how to start working with Golem step by step in minutes**.

!!! info
    **Skipping ahead**
    
    * If you have a development environment already configured with the prerequisite requirements, you can go ahead and [skip the first section](quickstart.md#installing-yagna-requestor) and move on from the next one.
    
    * If you have already installed the yagna daemon and configured the requestor correctly, [go straight to the third section](quickstart.md#building-your-first-javascript-app-on-golem-network).

## Preparing the environment

!!! info
    **Prerequisites**
    
    * OS X 10.14+, Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 or Windows
    * Familiarity with the command line
    * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version newer than or equal to 16.0.0
    * Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) version 1.22.3 or newer
    * Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

In this section we will introduce how to run a Simple Node Application on Golem Network. The created project will be using a build setup based on pre-built image ([Golem Image](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/vm-runtime)) and allow us to run our Node.js script on a rented computer on Golem ([Provider](https://handbook.golem.network/introduction/provider)).

Make sure you have a version of Node.js installed newer than or equal to 16.0.0:

```bash
node --version
```

Make sure you have a version of Yarn newer than or equal to 1.22.3 installed:

```bash
yarn --version
```

Make sure you have any version of Git installed:

```bash
git --version
```

## Installing yagna requestor

To start working with Golem network we need to install the `yagna` daemon on our local machine. In the simplest terms, the `yagna` daemon allows you to communicate with Golem Network and perform operations on it. A "Requestor" is what you are right now, someone who is renting computing resources on Golem Network.

=== "Easy installation"
    
    You can install it using our helper script like this:
    
    ```bash
    curl -sSf https://join.golem.network/as-requestor | bash -
    ```
    
    You might be asked to modify your PATH afterwards.
    
    !!! warning
        
        On Windows, only the manual installation is supported.

=== "Windows Manual installation"

    Alternatively, if you can't install in easy way, you will do it manually in the following way:
    
    1. Download the requestor package - prefixed `golem-requestor` - appropriate for your platform from: [https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/latest](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/latest).
    2. Unzip the archive to extract the two files: `yagna.exe` and `gftp.exe`.
    3. Copy those files to `C:\Windows\System32`.


=== "Unix Manual installation"

    Alternatively, if you can't install in easy way, you will do it manually in the following way:
    
    1. Download the requestor package - prefixed `golem-requestor` - appropriate for your platform from: [https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/latest](https://github.com/golemfactory/yagna/releases/latest).
    2. Unpack `yagna` and `gftp` binaries and put within somewhere in your PATH (e.g. copy them to /usr/local/bin on Unix-like systems) or add the directory you placed the binaries in to your PATH.


Verify if `yagna` available in command line:

```bash
yagna --version
```


Verify if `gftp` available in command line:

```bash
gftp --version
```


If the above commands executed correctly, congratulations you have just installed the `yagna` daemon in your environment. If not, a common fix is to simply close and re-open your terminal since the PATH may not be updated in that session.

!!! info

    If you have encountered problems, or would you like to learn more details about the requestor and `yagna` installation, please take a look in here: [How to install requestor tutorial](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development)

### Configure requestor and fund your wallet

To start using Golem Network you need a key, which will be also be the address of your wallet. For the purposes of this tutorial we are using testnet. To generate a key and fund your wallet follow these steps:

#### Start the daemon

To perform any operations on the Golem Network the `yagna` daemon must be running. To do this, open a command line window and type:

```bash
yagna service run
```

!!! warning

    Important: After you launch the daemon, leave it running in the background while you proceed with the tutorial.

!!! info

    If you have encountered problems please take look on [Run the daemon](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development/#run-the-daemon) section

#### Generate the app key

To use the network you must have your own unique key for which is used for billing. To generate the key, make sure you have running `yagna` daemon from the [previous step](quickstart.md#start-the-daemon), leave it running in the background and in a separate command line window type in:

```bash
yagna app-key create requestor
```

**Please, note the key down**

!!! info
    **Saving and using the key**
    
    The key created should ideally be noted down and be easily accessible as you will need it later.
    
    However, don't worry if you forgot to do it as the key can be retrieved again by running `yagna app-key list`.

#### Get some funds

In order to be able to request tasks on Golem Network, you'll need some credits on the network (GLM tokens). To get some on test credits to be used on the testnet, type in the command seen below. The testnet is a limited testing playground where no real money is transacted and features can be tested.

```bash
yagna payment fund
```

Once you run the command, give some time to transfer credits to your wallet. You can verify whether you already got the credits with:

```bash
yagna payment status
```

!!! info

    If you have encountered problems, or would you like to learn more details about the funding process, please take a look in here: [How to get some GLM tokens](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development/#get-some-test-glm-tokens)

#### Init yagna daemon as a sender

When you have already configured the yagna daemon and it is time to initialize as a sender.

```bash
yagna payment init --sender
```

## Building your first JavaScript app on Golem Network

Congratulations you are now ready to start building your first JavaScript app on the Golem Network.

### Create a new Node.js project

Create a new Node.js project by typing in the command line:

```bash
mkdir golem-tutorial-js
cd golem-tutorial-js
yarn init golem-tutorial-js
```

### Create a Node.js script that will execute task on provider

Add `yajsapi` to your project:

```bask
yarn add yajsapi
```

#### Import TaskExecutor

Create an `index.js` file in the main folder and import `TaskExecutor` from `yajsapi`:

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";
```

After importing `TaskExecutor` we have to create IIAFE (Immediately Invoked Async Function Expression) in index.js body, because `TaskExecutor` provides async methods:

```js
(async () => {
    //... Function body in here
})();
```

#### Create TaskExecutor instance

In our body function first we have to create executor using factory method [Executor.create()](../docs/classes/executor_executor.TaskExecutor/#create). As a parameter we will provide image hash, where Node.js is already installed.

```js
const executor = await TaskExecutor.create("529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4");
```

!!! info

    For the testing purposes we are providing pre-built image with Node.js already installed: `529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4`

#### Define task to run on provider instance

As the first task we would like to see the node version that is running on the given image. For this purpose we would like to call the `node -v` command on the provider.

Let's first create task function that we would like to run on provider. The function named as Worker and implements [Worker](../docs/modules/task_work/#worker) interface.

```js
const taskToRunOnProvider = async (workerContext) => {
    // ... body of task that will be run on same provider
}
```

#### Define commands to run in the task scope

This function gets first parameter `workContext` that is a [WorkContext](../docs/classes/task_work.WorkContext) object. This object allow you set the commands that you want to run in the scope of one task on one provider. So the command we would like to run on the provider is `node -v`:

```js
const commandToRunInProviderShell = "node -v";
const result = await workerContext.run(commandToRunInProviderShell);
```

To access `stdout` on the result object, simply access the `stdout` property.

#### Run the task on Golem Network

To run above defined task `taskToRunOnProvider` on the Golem Network, we must pass it as a parameter of the `run()` method on the instance of the `executor`.

```js
await executor.run(taskToRunOnProvider);
```

#### Finish gracefully task executor

On the end you should finish working with Golem Network by calling the `end()` method on the running instance of executor.

```js
await executor.end();
```

#### So lets put everything together:

Now put all the code together. You should get an `index.js` file that looks like the following:

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";

(async () => {
   const executor = await TaskExecutor.create("529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4");

   const taskToRunOnProvider = async (workerContext) => {
      const commandToRunInProviderShell = "node -v";
      const result = await workerContext.run(commandToRunInProviderShell);
      return result.stdout;
   }

   const taskResult = await executor.run(taskToRunOnProvider);
   await executor.end();
   
   console.log('Task result:', taskResult);
})();
```

### Run the first script on Golem Network

If you have the executor ready, it's time to run the script on the Golem Network.

#### Setup YAGNA\_APPKEY

In order for the requestor agent to connect with the `yagna` daemon, you need to provide it with the previously-generated app key from step [Generate the app key](quickstart.md#secondly-generate-the-app-key-wallet):

=== "MacOS / Linux"

    **On MacOS / Linux type in command line**
    
    ```bash
    export YAGNA_APPKEY=insert-your-32-char-app-key-here
    ```

=== "Windows"

    **On Windows type in command line**
    
    ```bash
    set YAGNA_APPKEY=your-32-char-app-key
    ```

!!! info

    If you don't remember your key you can always check it by typing in the command line: `yagna app-key list`

#### Run your first app on Golem Network

To run your script on the Golem Network simply run the command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Result in the command line will look like:

### Refactor of the existing code

For the purpose of understanding the work with the executor, we have divided the code into small parts, but we can write it much simpler and refactor it to this form:

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";

(async () => {
  const executor = await TaskExecutor.create("529f7fdaf1cf46ce3126eb6bbcd3b213c314fe8fe884914f5d1106d4");
  const result = await executor.run(async (ctx) => (await ctx.run("node -v")).stdout);
  await executor.end();

  console.log("Task result:", result);
})();
```

It looks cleaner and more simple. Isn't it?

## Run Node.js script on provider

Now that you know how to run a simple command in the provider's shell, it's time to go one step further. In this section, we will create a simple script which we will then send to the provider and execute it using Node.

### Create task script

For starters, let's create a simple js file that will execute on the provider. Let's generate two random numbers and then add them and return the result of this operation.

To do this, let's create a task.js file:

```js
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
    min = Math.ceil(min);
    max = Math.floor(max);
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min); 
}

const num1 = getRandomInt(1000, 10000);
const num2 = getRandomInt(1000, 10000);

console.log(`Sum of ${num1} and ${num2} equal to ${num1 + num2}`);
```

You can test your code on your local machine by running:

```bash
node task.js
```

### Modify executor script

When we have a file with the task ready, we should modify our executor code to send it to the provider, and then execute it on the provider's machine.

#### Uploading the script to provider machine

When you look at the interface of the [WorkContext](../docs/classes/task_work.WorkContext) object, you will notice that there is an [uploadFile()](../docs/classes/task_work.WorkContext/#uploadfile) method, among others. This method is used to upload file to provider instance in a scope of single task. So in order to upload our task.js file to the provider we need to add the command:

```js
    await ctx.uploadFile("./task.js", "/golem/resource/task.js");
```

#### Modify code to execute uploaded Node.js file

The last step will be to modify the command executed on the provider `node -v` to a command that will execute our `task.js` file - `node /golem/work/task.js`.

Our `index.js` file after modifications will look as follows:

```js
import { TaskExecutor } from "yajsapi";

(async () => {

  const executor = await TaskExecutor.create("dcd99a5904bebf7ca655a833b73cc42b67fd40b4a111572e3d2007c3");

  const result = await executor.run(async (ctx) => {
      await ctx.uploadFile("./task.js", "/golem/work/task.js");
      const result = await ctx.run("node /golem/work/task.js");  
      
      return result.stdout;

  });
  await executor.end();

  console.log("Task result:", result);
})();
```

Result in the command line will look like:
